# PySimpleGui-Txt-Reader-Writer
A small PySimpleGui .txt file reader and writer I made for a friend. Input text into the text fields and it will create text files with the text in them in the same directory where the python script is located. It will read that text again the next time the script is opened.

## Usage
Either open the .py using an IDE like pycharm and make sure you have PySimpleGUI installed or download the Bbulldozer.exe file in the release section.
